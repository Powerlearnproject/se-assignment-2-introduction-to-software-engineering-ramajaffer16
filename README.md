What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to the entire software development process, focusing on creating reliable and maintainable software through structured methodologies. It involves systematic planning, design, development, testing, and maintenance.
Traditional Programming typically involves writing code to solve specific problems without a formalized process for managing the overall development lifecycle.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Agile: An iterative and flexible approach where development is carried out in small, incremental stages (sprints), allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation based on user feedback and changing requirements.
Waterfall: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is structured and requires thorough planning and documentation upfront, with less flexibility to adapt once development begins.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
1)Agile:
Approach: Iterative and incremental.
Flexibility: High; allows changes based on feedback and evolving requirements.
Process: Development occurs in small, manageable sprints or iterations, with regular reassessment and adaptation.
Customer Involvement: Continuous; regular feedback is integrated into each iteration.
Documentation: Minimal upfront; emphasis on working software and collaboration.
Preferred For: Projects with evolving requirements, high uncertainty, or need for frequent user feedback (e.g., startups, dynamic environments).
Waterfall:
2)Approach: Linear and sequential.
Flexibility: Low; changes are difficult and costly once development begins.
Process: Each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next.
Customer Involvement: Limited to early requirements gathering and final delivery.
Documentation: Extensive upfront; detailed planning and documentation are essential.
Preferred For: Projects with well-defined requirements and stable environments (e.g., regulatory compliance projects, where requirements are unlikely to change).

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project.

Process:
Requirements Elicitation: Gathering information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observations.
Requirements Analysis: Assessing and refining gathered requirements to ensure they are clear, feasible, and aligned with project goals.
Requirements Specification: Documenting the requirements in a detailed and structured format, such as a requirements specification document.
Requirements Validation: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible for implementation.
Requirements Management: Handling changes and updates to requirements throughout the project lifecycle to maintain alignment with stakeholder needs.

Importance:
Clarity: Provides a clear understanding of what the software needs to achieve, reducing misunderstandings.
Scope Management: Helps define project boundaries and prevent scope creep.
Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets user needs and expectations, leading to higher satisfaction.
Risk Reduction: Identifies potential issues early, minimizing costly changes and rework during later phases.



Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, self-contained units or modules. Each module performs a specific function and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.
Benefits:
Maintainability:
Isolation: Modules can be updated or fixed independently without affecting the entire system.
Readability: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and manage.
Scalability:

Extensibility: New features can be added by creating new modules or extending existing ones without major changes to the system.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects, reducing duplication of effort.
Overall, modularity enhances both the maintainability and scalability of software systems by promoting a clear structure and separation of concerns.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Unit Testing:
Focus: Tests individual components or functions in isolation.
Purpose: Ensures that each unit of code works correctly on its own.
Performed By: Developers.

Integration Testing:
Focus: Tests interactions between integrated components or modules.
Purpose: Verifies that combined units work together as expected.
Performed By: Developers or dedicated testers.

System Testing:
Focus: Tests the complete and integrated software system as a whole.
Purpose: Validates the end-to-end functionality and performance of the system.
Performed By: Quality Assurance (QA) team.

Acceptance Testing:
Focus: Tests the system against user requirements and expectations.
Purpose: Determines if the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.
Performed By: End-users or clients.

Importance of Testing:
Quality Assurance: Identifies and fixes defects early, ensuring a reliable and high-quality product.
User Satisfaction: Ensures that the software meets user requirements and expectations.
Cost Efficiency: Reduces the cost of fixing issues by addressing them early in the development process.
Risk Management: Minimizes the risk of failures and issues in production environments.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Importance in Software Development:
Collaboration: Facilitates teamwork by allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously.
History Tracking: Keeps a record of all changes, making it easy to review or revert to previous states.
Conflict Resolution: Helps manage and resolve conflicts that arise from concurrent changes by different developers.
Backup and Recovery: Provides a way to recover from mistakes or data loss by reverting to earlier versions.
Popular Version Control Systems:

Git:
Features: Distributed version control, branching and merging, high performance, and extensive support for collaboration through platforms like GitHub and GitLab.
Subversion (SVN):
Features: Centralized version control, fine-grained access control, and a straightforward model for tracking changes and managing versions.
Mercurial:
Features: Distributed version control, simplicity in design, and efficient handling of large repositories.
Perforce:
Features: Centralized version control, strong support for large binary files, and scalability for large teams and complex projects.
